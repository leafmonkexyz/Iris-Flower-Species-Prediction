# Iris-Flower-Species-Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project that predicts the species of iris flowers using logistic regression. The project is based on the well-known Iris dataset, and it demonstrates a basic classification task using scikit-learn.

Project Overview:

    Data Exploration: The project begins by loading the Iris dataset, exploring its structure, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
    Data Preprocessing: The features are scaled using standardization for better model performance.
    Machine Learning Model: A logistic regression classifier is used to build the predictive model.
    Model Training and Testing: The model is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the testing set.
    Accuracy Calculation: The accuracy of the model is calculated as a measure of its predictive performance.
    
  Dependencies:

    Python 3.x
    scikit-learn
    numpy

Dataset:

    The Iris dataset is included in scikit-learn's datasets module.
